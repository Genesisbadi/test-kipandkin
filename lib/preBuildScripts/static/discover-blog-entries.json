Budget airlines such as Cebu Pacific and AirAsia have specific weight restrictions and baggage fees. Philippine Airlines tends to have more generous allowances but also has restrictions for carry-on and checked baggage. Before packing, check your airline&rsquo;s website for exact weight and size guidelines to avoid unexpected charges.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Discovery Tip: For short trips, try fitting all your essentials into a carry-on bag to save time. You can check-in online and head straight to your boarding gate without waiting for checked luggage to be processed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Use mobile check-in</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tinyeditor_uploads/YLrTz04l11oJEaKDcWh6h628ih383QkrjBBMdk76.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Make the most of your travel day by checking in online through your airline&rsquo;s mobile app. Most airlines in the Philippines allow mobile check-in 24-48 hours before your flight, giving you plenty of time to select your preferred seat, download a digital boarding pass, and avoid long lines. With your mobile boarding pass in hand, you can proceed directly to the security checkpoint or bag drop counter when you arrive at the airport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Carry essential travel documents</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tinyeditor_uploads/OWMN3dAcWlx7P3wEOZdBOMnbOmpaX2Xggl53acdQ.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Keep all your travel documents organized and within easy reach. This includes your boarding pass, government-issued ID, and any necessary health or travel declaration forms. Airports in the Philippines often accept digital boarding passes, but it&rsquo;s still wise to carry a printed copy as backup. For frequent travelers, consider using a travel wallet or passport holder to keep everything organized in one place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Arrive early, but not too early</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tinyeditor_uploads/rEOnNocnE0ice3nfYUg9Klcggo93Iz2mwGqHQLR6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For domestic flights, arriving at the airport 2-3 hours before departure is usually enough time to check in, pass security, and reach your gate. Philippine airports can be bustling, especially during peak seasons or holidays, so it&rsquo;s wise to give yourself a buffer without arriving too early. If you're flying from a major hub like Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Manila or Mactan-Cebu International Airport, arriving early allows you to explore the shops, grab a meal, or even enjoy airport lounges. Smaller, regional airports in Coron, Davao, and Negros Occidental have limited facilities, so spending hours there might not be ideal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Arrange hassle-free transfers</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tinyeditor_uploads/ewvDg0TMxp7MoEd193yhKEf56uVAb4udHtj3XJtx.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Arriving at your destination can be stressful if you haven&rsquo;t arranged your transport.

However, some remote locations may require pre-booked transfers or private shuttles, and ride-hailing services might not operate in all regions. For a truly seamless travel experience, book directly with Discovery to enjoy complimentary airport transfers for the resorts, while city hotels offer transportation services at an additional cost.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the right approach, navigating domestic flights in the Philippines can be a breeze.

Start by identifying your main goal&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s shedding a few pounds, building muscle, enhancing your endurance, or maintaining overall wellness. Knowing what you want to achieve will help tailor a structured workout schedule that meets your specific needs.

A waterproof bag is also essential to protect your belongings.</p>\n<p>Insect Repellent: Rainy weather can bring out mosquitoes and other insects. Consider bringing repellent or natural alternatives like citronella oil to protect yourself from bites.</p>\n<p>Portable Charger: Packing a portable charger is essential for any trip, especially during the rainy season when power outages and limited charging opportunities are more likely.
