Here are some must-haves for your trip:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Waterproof Gear: Invest in high-quality waterproof gear, including a durable jacket, rain shoes, and a sturdy umbrella. These items will keep you dry and comfortable as you explore. A waterproof bag is also essential to protect your belongings.</p>\n<p>Insect Repellent: Rainy weather can bring out mosquitoes and other insects. Consider bringing repellent or natural alternatives like citronella oil to protect yourself from bites.</p>\n<p>Portable Charger: Packing a portable charger is essential for any trip, especially during the rainy season when power outages and limited charging opportunities are more likely. Some models include built-in flashlights and additional features which can save space in your luggage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Choosing the right destination</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/tinyeditor_uploads/xIxB3wPRkfcYRB4eCcNYGWv4eBf5QDdMAxBsrwWK.jpg\" alt=\"Airplane window seat view\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" /></p>\n<p>Selecting the perfect destination for your rainy season travel is crucial.
