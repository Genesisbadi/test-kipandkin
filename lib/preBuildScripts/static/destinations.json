Snorkel in the clear waters, stroll along the scenic pathways, or just sit back and enjoy the sound of the waves. It&rsquo;s the kind of place that invites you to slow down, take in the view, and appreciate a quieter side of island life.</p>","state_path":"main.items.6.description","type":"tinyeditor"}},{"id":"49767","type":"blueprintData","attributes":{"value":"[\"08d10407-1601-4274-9c77-15bebed730a0\"]","state_path":"main.items.7.image","type":"media","media":[{"id":"2079","type":"media","attributes":{"uuid":"08d10407-1601-4274-9c77-15bebed730a0","collection_name":"blueprint_media","file_name":"FXslXQmsCxV4hf2eC1Vl0mVcxOqAOx-metaQnVsYWJvZy5wbmc=-.png","custom_properties":[],"original_url":"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media/2079/FXslXQmsCxV4hf2eC1Vl0mVcxOqAOx-metaQnVsYWJvZy5wbmc%3D-.png","generated_conversions":{"image":"https://haspcms-discovery-suites.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/media/2079/conversions/FXslXQmsCxV4hf2eC1Vl0mVcxOqAOx-metaQnVsYWJvZy5wbmc%3D--image.jpg"},"type":"image"}}]}},{"id":"49768","type":"blueprintData","attributes":{"value":"Bulabog Beach","state_path":"main.items.7.title","type":"text"}},{"id":"49769","type":"blueprintData","attributes":{"value":"<p>Bulabog Beach is Boracay&rsquo;s wilder, windier side, and a paradise for kiteboarders and windsurfers.
